# Repo structure

## Install folder

The files in here are meant to install only the entitled application, without worring about dependencies.

E.g.: The `install/drush.sh` script requires you to have composer or to `install/composer.sh` before running it.

## Uninstall folder

These files will complete uninstall and purge the application, and will try to remove its lingering folders, files, volumes, containers, pods and so on.

They do __not__ remove the required applications and libs.

## Purge folder

The purge files are meant to be bundles, uninstalling more than one application.

E.g.: The `purge/docker.sh` will completly uninstall _ddev_, _docksal_, _lando_ and _docker_.
